/**
 * An abstract [[ProxyTimer]] that provides callback methods which are called when
 * a task takes longer than the specified maximum runtime or if a task is observed
 * to be taking longer than the specified maximum runtime.
 *
 * @note Observation of slow task execution is performed when scheduling more work to
 *       avoid the overhead of another thread or timer checking on tasks. This results
 *       in lower overhead but means that slow running tasks may not be observed while
 *       executing. However, they will trigger a callback to the `slowTaskCompleted`
 *       regardless of whether additional work is scheduled.
 *
 * @note This makes assumptions that the underlying `Timer` will execute tasks
 *       sequentially in order to catch slow running tasks during execution. If the
 *       underlying `Timer` executes tasks in parallel the callback `slowTaskExecuting`
 *       will become unreliable. However, the `slowTaskCompleted` callback will remain
 *       reliable but must be a thread-safe implementation.
